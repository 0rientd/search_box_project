# SearchBox Project

In this project, where we used Turbo, SQL and Stimulus, we can search for articles with a real time search mechanism.

With a analytic view, we can see some information for your top articles search and all of your own history of search.
Also, we can see the trending articles what are being searched.

## How to install?
Start cloning the project to a folder and then, do the following commands:
```bash
  > bundle install
  > bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
  > bin/dev
```
Access it on `http://localhost:3000`
